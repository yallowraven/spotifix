# Spotifix

Spotifix is a simple Python script that listens for a specific key combination (Ctrl+Shift+S) and restarts Spotify when the keys are pressed. This is useful when Spotify stops responding, or if you simply want to restart the application quickly without manually closing and opening it.

## Requirements

- `keyboard` library
- `psutil` library

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yallowraven/spotifix.git
cd spotifix
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
py main.py
```

2. Press the `Ctrl+Shift+S` key combination to restart Spotify.
